# SkillReg — Agent Skill Management CLI

## Overview

SkillReg is a Go CLI tool with an interactive TUI for managing agent skills across multiple AI coding assistant providers. It solves the problem of manually copying and maintaining skills across different provider config directories.

**Core concept:** Git repositories are registered as "sources." Skills (directories containing `SKILL.md`) are discovered by scanning sources recursively. Skills are installed to provider instances via symlinks pointing back to the source repo. A SQLite database tracks all state.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **TUI framework:** BubbleTea + Lipgloss + Bubbles (Charm stack)
- **Database:** SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGo)
- **Git operations:** Shell out to `git` CLI
- **Release:** GoReleaser + GitHub Actions
- **Binary name:** `skillreg`
- **Runtime data:** `~/.local/share/skillreg/skillreg.db` (follows XDG convention; respects `$XDG_DATA_HOME` if set)

## Data Model

### Tables

**sources** — Git repositories containing skills

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| name | TEXT | Display name (e.g., "superpowers") |
| path | TEXT | Local filesystem path to git repo |
| remote_url | TEXT | Git remote URL (for display/reference) |
| auto_update | BOOLEAN | Whether to auto-pull on startup |
| last_checked_at | TIMESTAMP | Last fetch timestamp |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | When source was added |

**providers** — Agent platform definitions

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| name | TEXT | e.g., "Claude", "Codex", "Gemini" |
| config_dir_prefix | TEXT | e.g., ".claude", ".agents", ".gemini" |
| is_builtin | BOOLEAN | Default providers vs user-added |

**instances** — Specific provider installations (including aliases)

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| provider_id | INTEGER FK | References providers |
| name | TEXT | e.g., "claude-personal", "claude-work" |
| global_skills_path | TEXT | Resolved absolute path (tilde expanded), e.g., `/Users/vladyslav/.claude-personal/skills` |
| is_default | BOOLEAN | The "main" instance for this provider |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | When instance was added |

**skills** — Discovered skills from sources

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| source_id | INTEGER FK | References sources |
| name | TEXT | e.g., "brainstorming" |
| original_path | TEXT | Full path in source repo |
| description | TEXT | Parsed from SKILL.md |
| discovered_at | TIMESTAMP | When skill was found |

**installations** — Symlink tracking

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| skill_id | INTEGER FK | References skills |
| instance_id | INTEGER FK | References instances |
| symlink_path | TEXT | Actual symlink path created |
| installed_name | TEXT | Name used (may differ from skill.name if renamed) |
| installed_at | TIMESTAMP | When installed |
| status | TEXT | "active", "broken", "orphaned" |

### Constraints

- Skills subdirectory is always `skills/` — universal across all providers, not stored in DB. The `instances.global_skills_path` column stores the fully resolved path including the `skills/` suffix (e.g., `~/.claude-personal/skills`). The symlink formula is: `<global_skills_path>/<skill_name>`.
- `UNIQUE(source_id, original_path)` on `skills` table — prevents duplicates on rescan.
- `UNIQUE(skill_id, instance_id)` on `installations` table — prevents double-install.
- `UNIQUE(name)` on `providers` table.
- `UNIQUE(name)` on `instances` table.
- `UNIQUE(global_skills_path)` on `instances` table — prevents two instances pointing to the same directory, which would cause symlink conflicts.

## Default Providers

Seeded on first run:

| Provider | Config dir prefix |
|---|---|
| Claude | `.claude` |
| Codex | `.agents` |
| Gemini | `.gemini` |
| Cursor | `.cursor` |
| VSCode / Copilot | `.github` |
| Antigravity | `.agents` |

**Note:** Codex and Antigravity share the `.agents` config directory prefix. Since they map to the same physical directory (`~/.agents/skills`), only one instance can be created for `~/.agents/` (due to UNIQUE constraint on `global_skills_path`). During home directory scanning or manual instance creation, if the resolved `global_skills_path` already exists in another instance, the user is warned and the creation is blocked. The instance name is auto-suggested based on the directory name (e.g., `agents-default`).

No instances are created automatically. The scan offer is shown when zero instances exist and the user enters the Providers menu. If the user dismisses the scan, it is not shown again — they can add instances manually. This is tracked by checking instance count, not a separate flag.

**Home directory scan logic:** A config directory is "found" when `~/.<prefix>*/` exists as a directory (e.g., `~/.claude-personal/`, `~/.codex/`). The `skills/` subdirectory inside does not need to exist — it will be created on first skill install. Instance names are auto-suggested from the directory name without the leading dot (e.g., `.claude-personal` → `claude-personal`).

## TUI Flow

### Startup Sequence

1. Initialize DB (run migrations if needed)
2. Seed default providers if first run
3. Show main menu immediately
4. Concurrently: run `git fetch` on all sources in background goroutines
5. As fetches complete, update the notification banner in the main menu
6. For sources with `auto_update: true` — auto `git pull` + rescan after fetch completes

### Main Menu

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Skill Registry                     │
│                                     │
│  ⚠ 2 sources have updates          │
│                                     │
│  → Skills (34 available)            │
│    Sources (4 registered)           │
│    Providers (3 configured)         │
│                                     │
│  q quit                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Skills Menu

**Browse all** — table with skill name, source, and where installed. Filterable. Skills with the same name from different sources are disambiguated by showing the source name in parentheses (e.g., "context-files (dev-copilot)" vs "context-files (skills)"). Enter for details.

**Install skill:**
1. Fuzzy-searchable skill list
2. Multi-select target instances (with "all Claude", "all instances" shortcuts)
3. Collision detection:
   - If target exists as a plain directory: warn, offer to backup as `<name>.skill.bak.zip` and replace with symlink
   - If target exists as a symlink to a different source: warn, let user pick which source or rename
   - Same-name skill from different source: warn, let user pick or rename
4. Create symlinks, record in DB

**Uninstall skill:**
1. Show only installed skills
2. Multi-select which installations to remove
3. Remove symlinks, update DB

### Sources Menu

List all sources with status (up to date / N new commits / unavailable). Select a source to:
- Pull updates (with options for dirty/conflict states)
- Rescan skills
- Toggle auto-update
- Remove source

**Add source:** Enter path to local git repo directory. Validate it's a git repo, scan for skills, display found skills, confirm add.

### Providers Menu

List providers with their instances nested underneath. Select a provider to manage instances. Select an instance to see installed skills or remove it.

**Add instance:** Select provider, enter instance name, enter or confirm config directory path.

## Skill Discovery

Recursive scan of source repos for any directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. Scans all directories including dot-prefixed ones (`.claude/`, `.github/`, `.agents/`, etc.).

**Excluded directories:** `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/` — these are never scanned.

All discovered skills are treated as universal — installable to any provider instance regardless of their original location in the source repo.

The skill name is derived from the immediate parent directory of `SKILL.md`.

Skill description is extracted from `SKILL.md` by reading the YAML frontmatter `description` field if present, otherwise the first non-empty, non-heading line (not starting with `#`) of the file. If the file is empty or parsing fails, description defaults to an empty string. Malformed frontmatter is ignored (treated as no frontmatter). No other frontmatter fields are used.

## Symlink Management

### Creating Symlinks

Target path: `<instance.global_skills_path>/<skill_name>`

Example:
```
~/.claude-personal/skills/brainstorming → /Users/vladyslav/Projects/superpowers/skills/brainstorming
```

- Create parent directories if they don't exist
- On collision with plain directory: backup as `<name>.skill.bak.zip` in the same parent directory (overwrites any previous backup of the same name), then replace with symlink
- On collision with existing symlink: warn + pick/rename

### Health Checks

On startup or manual trigger:
- Iterate all installations in DB
- Check each symlink: exists? points to correct target? target still exists?
- Mark status: `active`, `broken` (symlink exists on disk but target directory is gone), `orphaned` (DB record exists but symlink file was removed from disk outside skillreg)
- Surface broken/orphaned in the UI with repair options

## Git Operations

### Fetch (startup, non-destructive)

For each source, run `git fetch`. Compare `HEAD` vs `origin/<branch>`, count commits behind. Display notification in main menu.

### Pull (manual or auto-update)

1. Attempt `git pull --ff-only`
2. On success: rescan for new/removed skills, update DB
3. On dirty working tree, offer options:
   - Stash changes and pull
   - Skip this source
   - Open terminal at source directory (suspends TUI, spawns user's shell at the source path, TUI resumes on exit)
4. On merge conflict / non-fast-forward, offer options:
   - Force pull (reset to `origin/<current-branch>` of the source repo)
   - Skip this source
   - Open terminal at source directory (suspends TUI, spawns user's shell at the source path, TUI resumes on exit)

### Post-Pull

- Detect new skills → add to DB
- Detect removed skills → mark installations as broken, notify user
- Existing symlinks remain valid (they point into the updated source directory)
